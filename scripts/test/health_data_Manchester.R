# Data preparation to match diseases and names from Cambridge physical activity meta-analysis

# Some specific cancers need adjustment to match GBD data to standardised
# JIBE disease list. Apart from name changes, the following cancers need transformation:
  
#  -   Priority: Head and neck cancer: sum of Larynx cancer + Lip and oral cavity cancer + Nasopharynx cancer + Other pharynx cancer

#  -   Less priority: Colon cancer, Rectum cancer: Colon and rectum cancer, apportioned based on ? incidence/prevalence rates

# -   Less priority: Lung cancer: Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer, apportioned based on comparison of ?
