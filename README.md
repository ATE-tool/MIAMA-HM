# Microsimulation model
A microsimulation model for health calculations. Inspired by the [Microsimulation-tutorial](https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial). We are particularly interested in a model that remembers each individual's characteritics and their behaviour and exposure over time. Specifically we are utilising `Sick-Sicker` model with memory component.([Appendix B_online_supp-samplev](https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial/blob/master/Appendix%20B_online_supp-samplev.R)).
