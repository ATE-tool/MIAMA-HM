## Health Microsimulation

This document explains the details of the `health microsimulation` model. It is inspired by the [Microsimulation-tutorial](https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial). The model is an individual based model, where it remembers each individual's characteritics and their behaviours and exposures over time, while keeping the overall count of health statistics using incidence and mortality rates. The model is flexible and generlizable to any setting - location, diseases and demographics.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
